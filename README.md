# Chat_Application_using_WebSockets_and_SpringBoot
This is my project on Spring Boot using WebSockets to develop a chat application.
Web Sockets are used to make connections to peer-to-peer to communicate.
https://start.spring.io/ was used to create the initial project.
It is a spring project initializer.
